# bowling
Two naive implementations of bowling alley

1) Rounds & players are dynamic
2) Can change the bonus for each strike/spare
3) Checks bounds 
4) Prints scores after the entire program
5) Modular enough to print scores after each round, change bonuses, add formats for scoreboards, change MAX_PIN_SCORE, etc.
6) Bowling.cpp contains simple point addition for spare/strike & bowling_bonus.cpp has an example to modify point reward system
